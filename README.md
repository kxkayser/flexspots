# flexspots
Flexspots provides point and click logging based on DXCluser Spots on the Flex 6000 series transceivers
Flexspots is written in Python usingthe QT5 framework.  It works in consjuction with K1BDO's Slicemaster for Flex 6000.  Flexspots currently supports logging to HRD Logging program version 6 and Log4OM Next Generation.  Additional loggiong programs will be added in the future. Use of the Slicemaster aggregation server running on port 7300 on the same host as Flexspots is a basic requirement.  Any version of Flex SSDR that supports the spots API will work.
